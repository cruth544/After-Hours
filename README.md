### After-Hours
After Hours is an exciting new app that allows users to find Happy Hour information from differing venues relative to their location.

### Our approach to Happy Hour App
With the many hours we put in per day here at GA, relaxing and decompressing over a cocktail, a glass of wine, or a cold one is necessary. Most of us do not live in the DTLA area and we felt that something useful for all is to have an app that would pull all the local Happy Hour information from nearby restaurants and bars. Additionally, it would be useful for users to be able to post reviews based purely on a venue's Happy Hour, and for owners of establishments to be able to update their information to keep it current.

### Technologies Used:
Happy Hour was built on:
-NodeJS
-Express
-Mongo DB
-HTML5
-CSS3
-jQuery/Javascript
-Bootstrap
-Google Maps API
-Yelp! API
### Installation instructions for any dependencies
Insert instructions for others to use our API
send request to appropriate URL and use JSON

Packages to install:
$ npm install --save path
$ npm install async
$ npm install cheerio
$ npm install request

Cheerio - allows us to load a web page for HTML scraping

Async - Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

Path (https://nodejs.org/api/path.html): This module contains utilities for handling and transforming file paths. Almost all these methods perform only string transformations. The file system is not consulted to check whether paths are valid.
A full list of dependancies are as follows:

   "dependencies": {
    "async": "^1.5.2",
    "bcrypt": "^0.8.5",
    "bluebird": "^3.1.4",

### Roadblocks/Issues:
-Our biggest issue was time. We weren't able to complete everything we wanted to include in this project
-Nested data was confusing and difficult to deal with
-Ability to search by hour and price (time issue)



## Future Additions
-Check-in capabilities
-Social media feeds from Instagram and Twitter
-The ability to access a ride share app (Uber/Lyft) through our After Hours App
-Messenger/chat capabilities
-Ablity to locate other After Hour goers who attended the same Happy Hour
