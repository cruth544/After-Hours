### Technologies used
Happy Hour was built using NodeJS, Express with Mongo DB. Additionally, Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Maps API, and Yelp! API were utilized. 

Node.js Packages needed to be installed:

Cheerio - allows us to load a web page for HTML scraping

Async - Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

Path (https://nodejs.org/api/path.html): This module contains utilities for handling and transforming file paths. Almost all these methods perform only string transformations. The file system is not consulted to check whether paths are valid.

### Our approach to Happy Hour App
With the many hours we put in per day here at GA, relaxing and decompressing over a cocktail, a glass of wine, or a cold one is necessary. Most of us do not live in the DTLA area and we felt that something useful for all is to have an app that would pull all the local Happy Hour information from nearby restaurants and bars. Additionally, it would be useful to for users to be able to post reviews based purely on a venue's Happy Hour, and for owners of establishments to be able to update their information to keep it current.
