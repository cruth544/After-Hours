# After-Hours

Cheerio - allows us to load a web page in order to scrap it for data.

### Our approach to Happy Hour App
With the many hours we put in per day here at GA, relaxing and decompressing over a cocktail, a glass of wine, or a cold one is necessary. Most of us do not live in the DTLA area and we felt that something useful for all is to have an app that would pull all the local Happy Hour information from nearby restaurants and bars. Additionally, it would be useful to for users to be able to post reviews based purely on a venue's Happy Hour, and for owners of establishments to be able to update their information to keep it current.
